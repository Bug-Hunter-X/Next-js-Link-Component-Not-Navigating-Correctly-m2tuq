# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js `Link` component where links render visually correctly but fail to navigate to the intended pages. The problem is likely related to incorrect routing configuration or a mismatch between the defined routes and the links in the component.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.
